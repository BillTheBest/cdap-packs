# Kafka Flowlet Library for CDAP


## Building the Library

The project is a multi-module maven project. It requires Maven 3.0+ and Java SDK 6+ to build.

### Prerequisites

The library supports both Kafka 0.7.x and 0.8.x. Since artifacts for Kafka 0.7.x are not available in the Maven
central repository, the project includes an artifact jar for Kafka 0.7.x.
You'll need to install the artifact into your local maven repository before building the library:

    mvn initialize -P install-kafka-0.7

### Build and Install Locally

After installing the kafka-0.7.2 artifact, you can build and install all artifact jars using:

    mvn clean install
   
or, to install the jars without running the unit-tests, use:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests
